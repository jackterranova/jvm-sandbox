### Overview

Exploring verbose GC and affects of heap size.

Particularly interesting are the differences in both output format and results between JVM versions (like 8 vs 12).

## On this branch

This is a just a setup of running a program that attempts to use some memory and see what happens during GC is GC actually happens.

In subsequent branches, we'll make the program more memory intensive, use different GC implementations and add instrumentation.
